Contributing
============

We are not seeking new committers now, but you are welcome to create a github issue explaining your requirements.

If you've found a bug, please contribute a failing [integration test](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-android-sdk/tree/nelson/contributing/embrace-android-sdk/src/integrationTest) case so we can study and fix it.

If you have a new feature idea, please get in touch with us [support@embrace.io](mailto:support@embrace.io) or create a github issue
