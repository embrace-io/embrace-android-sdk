# Embrace Example App

This demonstrates how to use Embrace's API to capture telemetry from various sources.

This example app builds from the same project as the Embrace SDK and therefore doesn't follow the
[integration instructions](https://embrace.io/docs/android/integration/) which are listed on Embrace's docs site.
