/**
 * A [ThreadPoolExecutor] that supports prioritisation of submitted tasks. Each task
 * must have a priorityInfo object that is associated with the task. Prioritisation is then
 * delegated to the supplied [Comparator].
 *
 * This executor assumes that all tasks submitted are operations that have some sort of logical
 * grouping that can be prioritised. Submitting all HTTP requests to the same executor will result
 * in good prioritisation. Submitting a bunch of miscellaneous tasks that have no relation to each
 * other will probably not.
