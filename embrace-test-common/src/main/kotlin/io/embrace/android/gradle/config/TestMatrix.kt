/**
 * Defines the test matrix we use in one place to ensure that test cases use sane version
 * combinations. Our strategy is to pick ~5 version combinations that are representative of our
 * supported range of versions. The theory is that most customers will fall somewhere along the
 * middle of the version range distribution.
 *
 * These versions should be regularly reviewed & updated. The AGP/Gradle compatibility matrix may
 * be helpful: https://developer.android.com/build/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-gradle
 *
 * If a specific version is required then we can add it, but we should strive to reduce special
 * cases wherever possible.
