  title: Embrace Envelope API
  description: |-
    The payloads we send to the Embrace backend do not map directly to an OTLP spec or even a specific concept. Rather, they will contain objects that map to OTel concepts like resources, spans, and logs, represented by a custom JSON serialization format that mirrors, more or less, the official Protobuf definitions. But the structure within which these wrapper objects live will be Embrace-specific and be tailored to our existing lifecycle.

    In general, all payloads will share a common envelope that contains shared attributes that we donâ€™t want to duplicate - largely what was included in appInfo, deviceInfo, and userInfo. It will also have a `data` object where custom, payload-specific data can be stored, which is unique for each payload type
