# embrace-android-instrumentation-power-save

Instrumentation that records when the device is in power save mode.

POC TODO: need to separate this from other APIs.

## TODO list

- Separate module for instrumentation-api
- Move bytecode instrumentation (or possibility of) to this module
- Figure out how instrumentation is installed by sdk module (reduce complexity)
- Consider moving integration tests to this module? Might not work.
- Greatly reduce deps
-
