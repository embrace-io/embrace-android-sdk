# Contributing

Before code can be accepted all contributors must read the [**code of conduct
**](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-android-sdk/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and complete our [**Individual Contributor License
Agreement (CLA).**](https://forms.gle/SjXadmUcVwh6NrU68)

Our code of conduct applies to all platforms and venues related to this project; please follow it in all your interactions with the project
and its participants.

## Pull request guidelines

We welcome all code contributions to the library. If you have a patch adding value to the SDK, let us know!

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

At a minimum, to be accepted and merged, Pull Requests must:

- Have a stated goal and a detailed description of the changes made.
- Include thorough test coverage and documentation, where applicable.
- Pass all tests and code quality checks on CI.
- Receive at least one approval from a project member with push permissions.
- Disclose use of AI. This can be categorised as none, autocomplete/research led by the developer, or generated mostly by the AI agent

Make sure that your code is readable, well-encapsulated, and follows existing code and naming conventions. Any suppression of lint
violations must be done in code and properly explained. The PR should comprise commits that are reasonably small with proper commit
messages.

Please also make sure your code compiles by running`./gradlew build`
